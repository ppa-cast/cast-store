This simple webapp is an alternative gallery for the [extendng.castsoftware.com](extendng.castsoftware.com) web site.
It aims to give a better visibility of the published extensions.

Visit the demo site: [https://ppa-cast.github.io/cast-store/](https://ppa-cast.github.io/cast-store/)

The extensions are distributed into 3 inboxes (New arrivals, Recent releases, Recent upgrades), and into categories:

- for inboxes, the extensions are ordered by publication date,

- for categories, the extensions are ordered by monthly downloads.

The mapping of extensions to categories is defined here: [extensions.js](extensions.js)

Deprecated extensions are classified as "deprecated" and are not displayed.

This webapp has been developped with [jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Embedded JavaScript templates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ejs), and the [extendng.castsoftware.com API](https://extendng.castsoftware.com/api/doc).
